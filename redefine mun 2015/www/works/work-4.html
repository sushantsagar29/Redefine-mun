			  <p> Almost every nation of the world, however insignificant or small in terms of population it might be, publishes at least weekly, if not daily, one newspaper. Together, hundreds of newspapers along with news magazines make up the modern world press. Many are independently owned, some are closely censored by government and others are government operated. Freedom of the press is not a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
			  <p>The principle player in this ebb and flow of information is the journalist. They go about each day in an often routine way collecting bits and pieces of a story, conducting interviews, taking notes at press conferences, and often stepping back through time at the library as they assemble each article, fact by fact. The modern journalist is as much an interpreter of the news as a reporter of the news. It’s not enough to report the news today, newspapers need to explain and analyze what’s happening and even speculate why it is happening. Journalism, therefore, demands of its practitioners the widest range of intelligence, knowledge, and experience, as well as natural and trained powers of observation and reasoning.</p>
