			<div class="text">
			  <p>The question that many people asked us when they heard about reDEFINE Model UN Conference is “Why?” To them we say, because this is a try for making a MUN in the Odisha circuit stand out in terms of the venue, the hospitality, the aura and of course the quality rather than the quantity.</p>
			<p>In the maiden session of the MUN we are simulating no more than one committee of the United Nations because we aim to give the delegates the best personalized service that they have ever come across in the Eastern MUN Circuit of India. The chosen committee to be simulated is the United Nations General Assembly – DISEC. Along with the UNGA DISEC we shall also of course be having the International Press, the eyes and ears of this conference.</p>
			<p>Many people talk about being the change they want to see. At reDEFINE MUN we want you to redefine the change you want to see in terms acceptable to the world as it is today.</p>
